## Objective


The purpose of this lab is to understand sparse matrix storage formats and their impacts on performance using sparse matrix-vector multiplication as an example. The formats used in this lab are Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Jagged Diagonal Storage (JDS).


The following figure illustrates the components of a JDS matrix and how it is logically constructed.


## Instructions

Edit the kernel and the host function in the file to implement sparse matrix-vector multiplication using the CSR format. Once complete, you can start working on the JDS format datasets.

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is
demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.
