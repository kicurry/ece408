## Code Project For Course ECE408
This is code project for ECE408(Applied Parallel Programming). And you can use this project as a good start for your own lab implementation. Here's how you finish your own project. [You can get all slices here](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECE408/Class+Schedule).

### 1. Compile & Run
First make sure that CMake and development tools are installed in your machine, then enter the following command:
``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```
### 2. Finish your own code based on template code
`./templates/mpx_template.cu` are template codes and you need to full fill these code files. For me, I add these implementations in `./imp/mpx.cu`.

### 3. Add your code to CmakeLists.txt
Once you finish your new implementation code, you need to add it to `CmakeLists.txt` so it can be compiled.
```cmake
// mpx_implement.cu is your implementation code file name.
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE(MPX_Implement /path/to/your/mpx_implement.cu ${wbhdr} ${wbsrc})
```

Executable files will be generated in under `./build/bin`, and any time when you update your implementation you just need to rerun `make` under `./build`. But if you update your `CmakeLists.txt`, you should run `cmake ..` first and then run `make` to compile all codes.

## Test Dataset
datasets for code test are under `./test_data`, you can use them to test your implementation with
``` bash     
# suppose you are in ./build directory

./bin/program -e <expected_output_file> -i <input_file_1>,<input_file_2> -o <output_file> -t <type>
```
The `<expected_output_file>` and `<input_file_n>` are the input and output files provided in the dataset. The `<output_file>` is the location youâ€™d like to place the output from your program. The`<type>` is the output file type: `vector`, `matrix`, or `image`. If an MP does not expect an input or output, then pass none as the parameter.

For example, if you want test mp3_implementatiton, you can run

``` bash    
# suppose you are in ./build directory

./bin/MP3_Implement -e ../test_data/mp03/0/output.raw \
-i ../test_data/mp03/0/input0.raw,../test_data/mp03/0/input1.raw \
-o ../test_data/mp03/0/res.raw \
-t matrix

# or you can just enter in one line
./bin/MP3_Implement -e ../test_data/mp03/0/output.raw -i ../test_data/mp03/0/input0.raw,../test_data/mp03/0/input1.raw -o ../test_data/mp03/0/res.raw -t matrix
```
And if you see logs like this, then congratulations, you have passed the test!

``` bash
"solution_exists": true,
"solution":{
"correctq": true,
"message": "Solution is correct."
}
```


## Generate your own dataset
You can generate your own dataset if you want more test. For example, you can use `MP2_Dataset` to generate dataset.

    MP2_Dataset -d /data/directory -ra 100 -ca 128 -rb 128 -cb 256
NOTE: `/data/directory` must exist.
